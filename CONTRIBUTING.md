#How To Contribute
I'll try to keep contributing simple to start out.

If you have a feature or bugfix you would like to add please fork the repository and create a branch off of the *develop* branch.
Prefix your branch with either "FEATURE\_", "BUGFIX\_", or something similar describing the type of update, and then add a descriptive name
such as "BUGFIX\_random\_files_erased".  Please try to avoid monolithic commits.  Once your update is complete, merge in any changes from
the develop branch and resolve conflicts locally.  Once all the conflicts are resolved, submit a pull request for the develop branch
and I will review the update and add any change requests or comments.  After all requests are complete I will merge your pull request 
into the devlop branch.
